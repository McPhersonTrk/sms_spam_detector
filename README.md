## Project Overview
The SMS Spam Detection App leverages a machine learning model to accurately classify SMS messages. It uses a pipeline comprising TF-IDF vectorization and Linear Support Vector Classification to process and predict the nature of the text messages.

##Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and install the required dependencies:

## Usage
The main application file is gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb. To start the application, run the Jupyter notebook and execute all cells. Once the Gradio interface is launched, you can input any text message to classify it as spam or not spam.

## Contributing
Contributions to the SMS Spam Detection App are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
